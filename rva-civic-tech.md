MEET OUR OUTREACH COORDINATORS!
David Malakouti is the Central Virginia Community Outreach Coordinator and he works hard to connect the resources of local government, social service providers, neighborhood leaders, members of Richmondâ€™s faith community, non-profit organizations, business leaders, and anyone else willing to help make Richmond a better place to live. He also regularly speaks to at-risk youth in Richmond about the consequences of gun and gang violence. To contact David, email him at dmalakouti@oag.state.va.us or give him a call at 804-786-1922. Learn more on our Community Resources page.
Virginia Rules is a law-themed educational program for Virginia middle and high school students.  The purpose of Virginia Rules is to educate young Virginians about the law and help them develop skills needed to make sound decisions, to avoid breaking laws, and to become active citizens of their schools and communities.  Last year, 55,000 students across the state learned about Virginia law through the Virginia Rules curriculum in sessions taught by school resource officers, teachers, juvenile probation officers, youth group leaders, and others who work with youth.  With over two dozen modules, the curriculum covers a wide array of law-related topics relevant to Virginia youth.  For more information, contact Virginia Rules Program Coordinator Shannon Freeman at 804-692-0484 or sfreeman@oag.state.va.us or visit the Virginia Rules website.
