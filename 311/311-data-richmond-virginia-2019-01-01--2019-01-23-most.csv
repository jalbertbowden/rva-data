As it exists, it is a drainage issue, a traffic obstacle and most importantly a safety issue for students/pedestrians and traffic.

Apparently, there was a meeting where this drain was discussed. I did not attend, don’t recall hearing about it until afterwards. But I’ve been thinking….I’m no engineer; bear with me. This is not a cure, it is a treatment. A person at the meeting told me the pipe from that storm drain is beyond repair and would be too costly to replace. What if a sump pump was placed in the storm drain space? (I’ve searched on line a bit – might need a sewage pump, due to cold - not sure) There is a city light pole nearby that could be used for power, the discharge could be directed across Rugby (shorter) to the storm drain there (which probably needs to be cleaned, BTW), or across Sunset and thence down the hill. The hose or pipe could be covered by one of those guards I’ve seen at the Folk Festival to protect electrical lines from vehicle traffic. (It would encourage folks to slow down, maybe) A sump pump would need to be in a wire cage, I think, due to debris. A sewage pump might need it as well. It would have to be an automatic one, with a float device. BTW - your form made me say brick or concrete is missing. Not the problem, but I put something in the block ."
