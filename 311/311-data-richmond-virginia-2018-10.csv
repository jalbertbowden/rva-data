I cleared the alley off all leaves up and down both sides of the alley 40+feet on Wed. 10/10/18 in preparation for the storms to come associated with hurricane Micheal. On Thur evening my son and I spent 45 min in water thigh deep continually racking at the storm drain until we were able to clear the debris off the top and allow the alley water to drain. This alley water has continually caused flooding of my basement at 2811 Ellwood Ave. The storm drain is 18 + inches lower than all of the alley around it and thus clogs with leaves too easily. I would like to met with Mr. Storm in this alley to discuss possible solutions to this on-going issue. In 2003 I had over $150,000. of storm water damage to my home after the city had closed one storm drain in the 2nd alley. The city then put in a larger storm drain behind 2813 which can handle the water for this city block. However, they have not addressed the ongoing issue of this storm drain clogging due to small amounts of leaves covering it. I have attached a picture of a possible solution: put larger rocks which will allow water to drain through and eliminate the approximately 2' x 4' storm drain cover from being continually clogged by small amounts of leaves.",,,,
