In the past, a very large heavy one has falling on our car causing damage. Currently, there are some branches from the tree that I had to move to my lawn, so that pedestrians would have a clear path. Please come look at this tree to remove dead portions. We are highly concerned about personal and vehicular damage, if this situation continues. Thank you Karen Olney If you also include the tree on the corner of Fitzhugh and Sauer in this request, this would be greatly appreciated. It has also problem branches on it. We would like a branch removed that fell during all the storm activity. It has been moved to the property line between 4300 and 4302 Fitzhugh. This branch is just one example of the branches in question, on my earlier request.",,,

I spoke to Duarte of call center on 7/25/18 since I had not heard anything. He told me William Shoup had entered notes: “found nothing,” but left ticket open. I had Duarte enter detailed info about paper road, etc., my number. Spoke to Sam of call center on 7/30/18 since I still had heard from no one. Sam was quite useless. I requested his supervisor be on the phone. I then spoke to Derek who I’ve spoken to multiple times. Each time he has assured me someone will call me and no one has. I told Derek that someone needs to call me from the city phone numbers he gave me so my phone will recognize the call. Otherwise my call killer may put out a false reply. There is a “paper road” which abuts my property. On paper, this road is named Bayou Court. I have been taking care of Bayou Court since I purchased the home almost 11 years ago. Please remove the fallen tree and take note of the approximately 12 other trees that will do the same thing eventually. They should be topped or somehow maintained so they do not hit my home. I made a complaint/request on this very issue two years ago during hurricane season and I was ignored. What I said might happen...did happen.
