As it exists, it is a drainage issue, a traffic obstacle and most importantly a safety issue for students/pedestrians and traffic.

Apparently, there was a meeting where this drain was discussed. I did not attend, don’t recall hearing about it until afterwards. But I’ve been thinking….I’m no engineer; bear with me. This is not a cure, it is a treatment. A person at the meeting told me the pipe from that storm drain is beyond repair and would be too costly to replace. What if a sump pump was placed in the storm drain space? (I’ve searched on line a bit – might need a sewage pump, due to cold - not sure) There is a city light pole nearby that could be used for power, the discharge could be directed across Rugby (shorter) to the storm drain there (which probably needs to be cleaned, BTW), or across Sunset and thence down the hill. The hose or pipe could be covered by one of those guards I’ve seen at the Folk Festival to protect electrical lines from vehicle traffic. (It would encourage folks to slow down, maybe) A sump pump would need to be in a wire cage, I think, due to debris. A sewage pump might need it as well. It would have to be an automatic one, with a float device. BTW - your form made me say brick or concrete is missing. Not the problem, but I put something in the block ."

I originally suspected that a car had driven over the curb and messed with the leveling of the soil, but after I personally added more soil to the spots that were sinking, the ground re-sunk after a few days. The only reasonable conclusion is that the structure of the sewer below is shifting and/or collapsing.

BUT someone from the Police Dept. needs to go out to the address of 3137 Lanewood Dr. and speak to the owner, who I believe is responsible b/c alot of children are always there hanging around near or in driveway. BUT my concern is that a basketball hoop is sitting along side the roadway and the kids are ALWAYS 'In the road' playing basketball and when my wife and I travel this street along with many others the kids act like they don't want to move out of the roadway for moving traffic and you have to actually come to a complete stop and the kids just look at you like you're crazy & seem to move purposely very slow out of the way. Something needs to be done where this basketball hoop is removed b/c a public street or roadway is not a basketball court and someone may get hurt if hit by a vehicle in the future. Also there is a basketball hoop in front of 3128 Lanewood (I believe is the address) too, that the kids use to play on before the one at 3137 Lanewood was setup. BOTH need to be removed from the side of the road preventing cars from traveling thru b/c of children playing & using a public roadway as a basketball court...... PLEASE ASSIST with this issue ASAP! It has been ongoing for too long now...... Thank you! A Very Concerned Citizen....."
