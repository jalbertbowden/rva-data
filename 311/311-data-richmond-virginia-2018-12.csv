The field engineer did not check for structural issues with the existing sewer system in the space between the road and the sidewalk (areas circled on a document attached). I originally suspected that a car had driven over the curb and messed with the leveling of the soil, but after I personally added more soil to the spots that were sinking, the ground re-sunk after a few days. The only reasonable conclusion is that the structure of the sewer below is shifting and/or collapsing. This is a potential danger to anyone walking down this sidewalk, and I request that DPU look further into this request."

BUT someone from the Police Dept. needs to go out to the address of 3137 Lanewood Dr. and speak to the owner, who I believe is responsible b/c alot of children are always there hanging around near or in driveway. BUT my concern is that a basketball hoop is sitting along side the roadway and the kids are ALWAYS 'In the road' playing basketball and when my wife and I travel this street along with many others the kids act like they don't want to move out of the roadway for moving traffic and you have to actually come to a complete stop and the kids just look at you like you're crazy & seem to move purposely very slow out of the way. Something needs to be done where this basketball hoop is removed b/c a public street or roadway is not a basketball court and someone may get hurt if hit by a vehicle in the future. Also there is a basketball hoop in front of 3128 Lanewood (I believe is the address) too, that the kids use to play on before the one at 3137 Lanewood was setup. BOTH need to be removed from the side of the road preventing cars from traveling thru b/c of children playing & using a public roadway as a basketball court...... PLEASE ASSIST with this issue ASAP!
