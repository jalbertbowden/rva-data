Besides repair, my request is to possibly asphalt the drainage ditch in front of my home. I live on the corner of Three Chopt Road and Boatwright -- which is the main entrance into the University of Richmond -- thus the drainage issue of the ditch becomes an aesthetic issue during rain, and also a flood-issue during heavy rains."
