Description: Represents "Carriageways," which are linear features positioned along the center of the road bed that supports vehicular traffic between two at-grade intersections. Carriageways are represented as single lines, unless a street is physically divided by a median or structure. In the case of divided streets, the Carriageways appear as double-lines; one centerline for each of the road beds on either side of the divided road.
