Air Quality Index Report
What does the report tell me?

The AirData Air Quality Index Summary Report displays an annual summary of Air Quality Index (AQI) values for counties or core based statistical areas (CBSA). Air Quality Index is an indicator of overall air quality, because it takes into account all of the criteria air pollutants measured within a geographic area. Although AQI includes all available pollutant measurements, you should be aware that many areas have monitoring stations for some, but not all, of the pollutants. Each row of the AQI Report lists summary values for one year for one county or CBSA. The summary values include both qualitative measures (days of the year having "good" air quality, for example) and descriptive statistics (median AQI value, for example).

Summary statistics for the current year are incomplete because data are still being reported and quality assured. Data for the current year are considered preliminary until May 1 of the following year. Therefore, comparing reported values for the current year with previous years may not be valid.
How can I sort the report?

You can sort the report by clicking on any column heading. The first time you click on a column, it will sort in ascending order. If you click again, it will sort in descending order.
What do the report columns mean?

# Days with AQI
Number of days in the year having an Air Quality Index value. This is the number of days on which measurements from any monitoring site in the county or MSA were reported to the AQS database.

# Days Good
Number of days in the year having an AQI value 0 through 50.

# Days Moderate
Number of days in the year having and AQI value 51 through 100.

# Days Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
Number of days in the year having an AQI value 101 through 150.

# Days Unhealthy
Number of days in the year having an AQI value 151 through 200.

# Days Very Unhealthy
Number of days in the year having an AQI value 201 or higher. This includes the AQI categories very unhealthy and hazardous. Very few locations (about 0.3% of counties) have any days in the very unhealthy or hazardous categories.

AQI Max
The highest daily AQI value in the year.

AQI 90th %ile
90 percent of daily AQI values during the year were less than or equal to the 90th percentile value.

AQI Median
Half of daily AQI values during the year were less than or equal to the median value, and half equaled or exceeded it.

# Days CO
# Days NO2
# Days O3
# Days SO2
# Days PM2.5
# Days PM10
A daily index value is calculated for each air pollutant measured. The highest of those index values is the AQI value, and the pollutant responsible for the highest index value is the "Main Pollutant." These columns give the number of days each pollutant measured was the main pollutant. A blank column indicates a pollutant not measured in the county or CBSA.
